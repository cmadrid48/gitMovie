### gitMovie
## Project Description:
_gitMovie_ is a front-end web application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows, view their details and ratings, and get recommendations for similar content. The application includes features such as the ability to filter the search results by "rating"; It also includes features such as the ability to filter the search results by "genre". The users can also view the history of previous movie searches. 


## User Story:
As a Connoisseur of fine films,(bored movie goer),

I want to be able to use a web application that recommends a movie to watch, and be able to input my preferences such as favorite genres and ratings.

So that I can recommend a movie based on those inputs.

Our front-end web application would include two APIs for movie recommendations, one to retrieve movie and TV show information,(based on user rating selection, and genre), and another to retrieve the ratings, reviews, and recommendations.
The application would allow users to search for movies and TV shows, view their details and ratings, and get recommendations for similar content.
The application includes features such as the ability to filter the search results by "rating"
It also includes features such as the ability to filter the search results by "genre"
Users can also view history of previous searches (would possibly be a separate page HTML)

# Acceptance Criteria:
Given: Website with search box including a Title and Other Recommended Alternatives.
WHEN I search for different genres of movies
THEN I'm presented with a list of movies relating to the requested search.
WHEN I'm presented with my list of movies I'd like to see some alternative recommendations (books, shows, other movies)
